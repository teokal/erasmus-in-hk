                    zone a lot, mostly by traveling. Traveling forces you to grow out of your shoes and reach the greatness
                    within yourself on a daily basis. You just need to get out of your comfort zone, otherwise you won’t
                    be able to grab small or big chances. If you don’t try out new stuff, challenge yourself and sometimes
                    do things that scare you, then you can stay at home just as well.</p>

                <p class="margintop10">If you want to have the best travel time ever, then you have to do things you have not done before. See the
                    world as a playground, try out and play with it. Maybe you just learn a new language, start to hitchhike,
                    try out a job you would normally never do or you hang out with people, who are completely different than
                    you are. Traveling brings you so many opportunities, but only, if you overcome your fear of getting out
                    of your comfort zone. It is just a crutual thing when you want to travel the world.</p>
