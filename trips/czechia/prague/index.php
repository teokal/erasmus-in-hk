                    <h4>Prague</h4>
                    <p>Prague is the capital and largest city in the Czech Republic, the 14th largest city in the European Union
                        and also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava
                        river, the city is home to about 1.3 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to
                        have a population of 2.6 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly
                        winters.
                    </p>

                    <p>Prague has been a political, cultural and economic centre of central Europe complete with a rich history.
                        Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque eras, Prague
                        was the capital of the kingdom of Bohemia and the main residence of several Holy Roman Emperors,
                        most notably of Charles IV (r. 1346â€“1378). It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and
                        its Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and Protestant Reformation,
                        the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia, during both World
                        Wars and the post-war Communist era.</p>

                <p>Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Prague has become one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.
                    Prague suffered considerably less damage during World War II than some other major cities in the region,
                    allowing most of its historic architecture to stay true to form. It contains one of the world's most
                    pristine and varied collections of architecture, from Romanesque, to Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo,
                    Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau, Cubist, Neo-Classical and ultra-modern.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Prague is classified as an "Beta+" global city according to GaWC studies, comparable to Vienna, Seoul and
                    Washington, D.C. Prague ranked sixth in the Tripadvisor world list of best destinations in 2016.[13]
                    Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 6.4 million
                    international visitors annually, as of 2014. Prague is the fifth most visited European city after London,
                    Paris, Istanbul and Rome. Prague's low cost of living makes it a popular destination for expats relocating
                    to Europe.</p>
