                    <h4>Budapest</h4>
                    <p>is the capital and the most populous city of Hungary, and one of the largest cities in the European Union.
                        With an estimated 2016 population of 1,752,704 distributed over a land area of about 525 square kilometres
                        (203 square miles), Budapest is also one of the most densely populated major cities in the EU. Budapest
                        is both a city and county, and forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area, which has an area
                        of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786, comprising 33 percent
                        of the population of Hungary. The Budapest metropolitan area had a GDP of $141.0 billion (€129.4
                        billion) in 2016, accounting for 49.6 percent of the GDP of Hungary. GDP per capita in the city is
                        $64,283, which means 148% of the EU average measured on purchasing power parity. Thereby the city
                        is among the top 100 GDP performing cities in the world and making it one of the largest regional
                        economies in the European Union.</p>
